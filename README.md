# Python
>I am a bachelor science of Informatics and Mathematics from Indiana University Bloomington. I really love programming. My undergraduate studies helped me enhance my programming knowledge and skills. I believed in "work hard and play hard", so I devoted lots of my efforts on the academic courses to enhance my knowledge. I believed that my solid educational background will contribute to my future jobs. During my free time, I like to re-construct my computer and design the desktops, and I enjoy playing computer games with my friends. For both realistic world and game world, I am able to bring both flexible and innovated idea to approach problem solving. I always have flexible thoughts and innovated ideas to approach problems from various ways.
